I performed EDA on Covid 19 reports.                   
The dataset contains rows such as :Province/State, Country/Region, Lat, Long, Date, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered, Active, WHO Region.                             
The data was checked out on for:                     
1.Understanding the data               
2.Describing it              
3.Checking the uniqueness                                        
4.Cleaning it                  
5.Checking for any null values                       
6.Removing redundant values                       
I also generated various statistical charts based on the data.                 
I've even uploaded the dataset used by me for ease of access.                 
The code was written in Kaggle notebook.
